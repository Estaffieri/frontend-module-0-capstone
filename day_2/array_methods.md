pop: removes the last item in an array and returns that element.
push: adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
shift: removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
unshift: adds one or more elements to the front of an array and returns the new length of the array.

Bonus: it sounds like a Daft Punk song.
