## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
    A function groups together statements related to a specific task. Through calling it can be reused throughout a program without having to write the function again. I keep thinking of it like a stamp.

1. What is a parameter?
    Information passed into and needed by the function to answer accurately.

1. What is a return value?
    The response from a function.

1. In the space below, create a function named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
    function hello(){
      console.log("Sam I am");
    }
    hello();
1. Create a function named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
    function hello_someone(){
      name = "Sam";
      console.log(name + " I am!");
    }

1. How would you call or execute the function that you created above?
    hello_someone();

1. What questions do you still have about functions in Javascript?
  I feel like some of the examples I created are duplicating from arguments declared in the function and then also in the console.log portion. I want to play around with them and see where the answer is printing from, but I don't feel I have the time at the moment.

  How do we recognize when it is appropriate to use a function when building a program?
